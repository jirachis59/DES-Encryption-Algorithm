# DES Encryption Algorithm

## Project Description
This project is a Java-based implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm with RSA-based key management.  
It demonstrates secure client–server communication where DES is used for data encryption and RSA is used for secure key exchange.  
The project was developed using Apache NetBeans IDE as part of an academic cryptography course.

## Algorithms Used

### 🔹 Data Encryption Standard (DES)
DES is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that encrypts data using a 56-bit secret key.  
It operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext and produces 64-bit ciphertext through multiple rounds of permutation and substitution.

### 🔹 RSA Algorithm
RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm used in this project for:  
- Secure generation of encryption keys  
- Secure exchange of DES keys between client and server
